    "threads": 50,
    "delay": {
        "min": 2,
        "max": 5
    },
    "tasks": true,
    "referral_code": "your_referral_code",
    "blacklisted_tasks": [
        "task_id_1",
        "task_id_2"
    ]
}
```

### Configuration Options

- `use_proxy`: Enable/disable proxy usage (boolean)
- `threads`: Number of concurrent threads (integer)
- `delay`: Min and max delay between requests in seconds
- `tasks`: Enable/disable task automation (boolean)
- `referral_code`: Your referral code for authentication
- `blacklisted_tasks`: Array of task IDs to skip

## Required Files

1. `query.txt`: Contains account query strings (one per line)
2. `proxy.txt`: List of proxies (if proxy support is enabled)
3. `config.json`: Configuration file
4. `tokens.json`: Automatically generated file for token storage

### Proxy Format
```
http://username:password@ip:port
socks4://ip:port
socks5://ip:port
```

## Usage

1. Set up your configuration in `config.json`
2. Add your account query strings to `query.txt`
3. (Optional) Add proxies to `proxy.txt` if using proxy support
